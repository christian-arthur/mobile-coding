This repository contains my efforts to create scripts that will allow me interact with Github from Pydroid, a development environment on Android. I couldn't find a better solution for interacting with Github from Android. Right now it's hard to be productive from a Galaxy but these scripts might be useful to someone who uses a foldable phone (which I hope to get next for my personal phone). Would appreciate any feedback or input on how to develop software productively from a phone, when on the go, taking lunch break, etc.
